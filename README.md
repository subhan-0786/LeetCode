**🚀** **LeetCode Solutions Repository**

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! 🌟

This repository is a collection of my daily problem-solving efforts on LeetCode, focusing on three core areas:

**🧠 Focus Areas**

Top 150 Interview Questions: A handpicked selection of the most frequently asked and challenging problems in technical interviews. Perfect for anyone looking to prepare thoroughly for their next big interview.

Random Questions: A diverse set of problems that challenge various aspects of algorithms, data structures, and logical thinking. These are designed to keep my skills sharp and versatile.

Daily LeetCode Challenges: I consistently engage with LeetCode's daily challenges to maintain a strong problem-solving routine and stay updated with new and varied problems.

**🔍 About This Repository**

This repository contains the source codes for all the problems I solve. Each file here represents a solution to a problem that I've worked on, with all the technical details, logic, and strategies discussed extensively in my [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@subhanamjad507).

By maintaining this repository, I aim to:

--> Track my progress over time.
--> Share my solutions with the community.
--> Offer a resource for others preparing for interviews or improving their coding skills.
--> If you're looking for in-depth explanations and a detailed breakdown of each problem, please visit my Medium profile where I dive deep into the approaches and thought processes behind these solutions.
